# Google-Code-Jam
My coding attempts at various Google Code Jam Competitions

This repository stores all my attempts at various Google Code Jam Competitions and practices for these. I coded in C++ for the majority of the problems.

Template.cpp is my basic template used for all problems and cjheader.h is a header file that is included in the template in order to make the template file neater and more readable.

All code is by me except for .cpp files named with "_ext" or "_extsol" suffixes. These have been downloaded from the Google code jam site as examples of correct solutions for me to improve my own work.
